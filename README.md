# ReKons_Exploit_Collection
Collection of the best exploits for CVEs &amp; whatnot I could find

## None of the code in this repository belongs to me
This repo only aim is to create a collection of the best exploits for vulnerabilities.
All the rights whatever go to their respective owners, the repo will contain mostly pristine forms of them unless noted otherwise.
Licenses readmes etc. are included as well.

## Why is this?
Because I got very very angry one day that subpar exploits appear as top search result and decided to "do it myself"... kind of.
Zip files may or may not contain additional instructions from me such as ready to go commands to run to get e.g. reverse shell, read some sensitive file etc.
